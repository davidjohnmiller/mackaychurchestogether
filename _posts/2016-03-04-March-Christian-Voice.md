Pontius Pilate famously said ‘What is truth?’ Ironically Truth was standing right in front of him in the person of Jesus Christ, but he couldn’t see it.  Jesus had just informed Pilate that He indeed was a witness to the truth and the statement opened Pilate’s true condition: Confusion.
 
Confused people easily believe lies and become trapped by them.  There is a culture war sweeping our nation today with one side intent on shifting the Judeo-Christian value system to the extreme right of life. In doing so this group hopes it can then hi-jack the language in order to twist it to mean other things.  Anyone who then challenges these new ‘norms’ can be, as so well put by Melanie Phillips in her book Guardian angels, ‘shut down, bullied and labelled as extremists, bigots or enemies of humanity’. Western cultures are being polarised by this deliberated ploy to change the values of each nation.  The result is: Confusion.
 
Americans are confused.  They are voting for Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton but don’t really want either as their next President.  What America, Australia and the West needs is the Truth back on centre stage.
 
Jesus said as recorded in the book of John (Chapter 18, verse 37) ‘Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.’
 
Pilate evidently never came to the knowledge of the truth. Eusebius, the historian and Bishop of Caesarea, records the fact that Pilate ultimately committed suicide sometime during the reign of the emperor Caligula—a sad ending and a reminder for everyone that ignoring the truth always leads to undesired consequences.
 
My prayer is that all people will come to the knowledge of truth and make the right choices for their life.
